# ðŸš€ Quantifying the Relevance of Youth Research Cited in the US Policy Documents
 
<p align="justify">
In recent years, there has been a growing concern
 and emphasis on conducting research beyond academic or sci
entific research communities, benefiting society at large. A well
known approach to measuring the impact of research on society
 is enumerating its policy citation(s). Despite the importance of
 research in informing policy, there is no concrete evidence to
 suggest the researchâ€™s relevance in cited policy documents. This
 is concerning because it may increase the possibility of evidence
 used in policy being manipulated by individual, social, or political
 biases that may lead to inappropriate, fragmented, or archaic
 research evidence in policy. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the
 degree of relevance between research articles and citing policy
 documents. </p>

 In this paper, we examined the <b>scale of contextual relevance <\b> of youth-focused research in the referenced US policy documents using natural language processing techniques, state of-the-art <b> pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) </b>, and <b> statistical analysis </b>. Our experiments and analysis concluded that <i> youth-related research articles that get US policy citations are mostly relevant to the citing policy documents. </i> </p>
